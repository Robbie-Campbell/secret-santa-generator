# secret-santa-generator

### :santa: tl;dr Sends secret Santas to pseudo random emails and names :santa:

##### This file takes in a dictionary into a constructor method, including emails and names, and when the email_sender function is run it assigns secret santa values to the end user.

# This project used smtplib to send emails some new thing i have learned are:

> smtp python linking

> MIMEtext and html email layouts

> kwargs methods (for the first time ever! (i get it now))

##### A single file document, quite simple but works as needed! only patch considerations would be to implement better randomness, but as a simple 2 hour project it works as needed.

:shipit: happy hacking! :shipit:
